Use of Xilinx RFSoC with inbuilt multi-channel RFADC and RFDAC is one of the promising technology to mitigate the challenges. Based on availability of Gen3 RFSoC devices, two numbers of S-Band MRU is planned to be developed as Design Verification Model (DVM) along with a Test Jig consisting of external synchronizer to prove multi-board synchronization. Based on the availability of newer devices in future which can support up to X-band signal generation and X-Band direct RF sampling, development of X-Band MRU DVMs will be taken up. The S-band and X-band architecture of MRUs will be similar except the clocking scheme and the front end receiver ahead of the RF ADC. The main function the Multi-Channel Receiver Unit (MRU) are reception of eight channels of S-band RF signals and carries out low noise amplification and filtering, reception of dwell parameters from external subsystem over 10G Ethernet on multimode fiber or Gigabit Ethernet on copper, sampling of RF signals, performing Digital Down Conversion to create Baseband I/Q data, multiplexing eight channel baseband data, sending to external subsystem over 10G Ethernet on multimode fiber. It is also responsible for synthesis of RF signals using Digital Up Conversion of baseband signals and RF DACs. The baseband signals are stored as I/Q data in internal memory. It receives master clock references over optical/RF lines, critical timings over LVDS, synchronizes with other MRUs, and provides sampling clocks to ADCs and DACs, clock to FPGA.', './MRUimage.jpg')">MRU (S Band & X Band)</div>

It is planned to establish the design and development technology for spherical solid Radome of diameter more than 22m diameter in the country.  The design shall involve EM and structural design of the radome with multiple panels, optimization of the joints, and selection of materials and testing of panels (EM, structural and environmental). The Radome panels shall be designed for various frequency bands. (S, X and Ka band). Radomes involve multiple discipline, viz. EM, structural and composites. Potential of Indian Industries in the field of composites will be tapped in to meet the requirements.', './SphericalRadomeimage.jpg')">Spherical Radome</div>

Metamaterial can be realized using various periodic structures such as Thin Wire (TW) (results into negative ε), Split Ring Resonator (SRR)(results into negative μ),Omega (results into negative ε and negative μ) (see Figure 9). Each application of metamaterial has different unit cell which is repeated to form periodic structure. Metamaterials have been used in many diverse field such as photonics, microwaves circuits & microwave antennas. They can be used to make cloaking devices, make miniaturized microwave circuit components like couplers filters etc.', './Metamaterialimage.jpg')">Meta Material based Antennas/ Antenna Arrays</div>

The main advantage of UAVs is their capability to perform measurements in the actual environment where antennas are going to operate, thus providing insight that cannot be obtained from lab measurements, which are typically focused on ideal, free-space scenarios. Their other advantages include access to appropriate measurement locations, high-resolution of the measured position, the use of simple hardware, reduced ground-reflection effects, and the potential to extract additional parameters. UAVs are used to measure the radiation pattern of antennas under real operating conditions, where the influence of environments, such as distortion due to a multipath or coupling to neighboring objects, can be considered. The measured radiation pattern can be utilized to detect faulty elements in an array or correct the tilt angle of an antenna and find null fills. Additionally, the measured data can be used in simulations or network planning to improve the performance of communication links. UAV-based measurement techniques have many advantages over airborne measurements with a helicopter and land-based measurements. LRDE has experience in open test ranges and near field measurement facilities.
